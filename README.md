# Read-Aloud

Read webpage content aloud using text-to-speech.

## Description

This Read-Aloud extension serves as a practical example and educational resource for learning how to build browser extensions using the WXT framework. It demonstrates common patterns and features, allowing you to explore and understand the development process for cross-browser extensions. While functional as a text-to-speech tool for reading webpage content, its primary purpose in this repository is to serve as a codebase for developers to study and learn from.

## Features

* **Read Entire Page:** The extension can extract and read the entire content of the current web page.
* **Read Selected Text:** Users can select specific text on a page, and the extension will read only the selected portion.
* **Context Menu Integration:** A right-click context menu option is available for start reading the entire page or the selected text.
* **Intuitive Popup Interface:** The extension's popup provides controls for:
  * **Play/Pause/Resume Button:** To toggle between playing, pausing, and resuming the reading.
  * **Stop Button:** To completely halt reading.
  * **Voice Dropdown List:** To choose the voice for reading.
  * **Volume Slider:** To adjust the reading volume.
  * **Speed Slider:** To control the reading speed (rate).
  * **Pitch Slider:** To modify the voice's pitch.

## Installation as an Unpacked Extension (For Developers/Testing)

### For Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ziptar/Read-Aloud.git
```

Navigate to the `Read-Aloud` directory:

```bash
cd Read-Aloud
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the extension:

```bash
npm run build
```

Load the extension:

1. Open your browser and go to the Extensions page. You can usually find this in the menu (`â˜°` or `...`) under "Extensions" > "Manage Extensions" or by typing `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/` or `brave://extensions/` in the address bar.
2. Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle switch in the top right corner.
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner.
4. Select the folder `.output/chrome-mv3` containing the extension's manifest file (`manifest.json`).
5. The extension should now be loaded and its icon visible in the toolbar.

### For Mozilla Firefox

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ziptar/Read-Aloud.git
```

Navigate to the `Read-Aloud` directory:

```bash
cd Read-Aloud
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the extension:

```bash
npm run build:firefox
```

Load the extension:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in the address bar.
2. Click the "Load Temporary Add-on..." button.
3. Select `manifest.json` file inside the extension folder `.output/firefox-mv2`.
4. The extension will be loaded temporarily for the current session. It will be removed when you close Firefox.
5. For permanent installation, you need to sign the extension or use Firefox Developer Edition/Nightly with `xpinstall.signatures.required` set to false in `about:config`.
