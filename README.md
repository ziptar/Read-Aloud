# Read-Aloud

Read webpage content aloud using text-to-speech.

## Description

Read-Aloud is a browser extension that allows you to listen to the content of web pages instead of reading them.

* **Context Menu Integration:** A right-click context menu option is available for start reading the entire page or the selected text.
* **Intuitive Popup Interface:** The extension's popup provides controls for:
  * **Read Aloud Button:** To start reading.
  * **Pause/Resume Button:** To pause or resume reading.
  * **Stop Button:** To completely halt reading.
  * **Voice Dropdown List:** To choose the voice for reading.
  * **Volume Slider:** To adjust the reading volume.
  * **Speed Slider:** To control the reading speed (rate).
  * **Pitch Slider:** To modify the voice's pitch.
